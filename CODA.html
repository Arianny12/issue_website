            <p>CODA do not have a lot of knowledge when it comes to using signed medical terms. As a CODA, I have experienced injustices made by those in this field, laughing and treating others as if they were less, without the power to take action due to being underage. A minor should not be interpreting for their deaf parents because it should not be any child’s responsibility to interpret when public facilities are required by law to do; bringing an interpreter. Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act establishes that healthcare facilities are prohibited to “rely on a minor child to interpret or facilitate communication, except in an emergency ”. There has been multiple occasions where I was asked to interpret for my mother although an appointment had been made previously, giving the hospital enough time to acquire an interpreter for the appointment. Imagine how a child feels when they do not know how to explain something that the doctor is saying to their parent, this can cause the child to give incorrect information causing a communication error, “where the smallest misinterpretation can cause a disastrous outcome for patients” (AMN Healthcare). AMN Healthcare explains that “in addition to the great risk that the practice [of making children interpret] creates, placing such a large responsibility on a child can cause significant psychological stress”. Hospitals breaking the law can damage the patient and their children, when asking a minor for interpretation. This causes stress on the child because they are pressured by the parent and the doctor to correctly explain what they are saying but sometimes children do not know how to interpret it because this could be a difficult job even for trained professionals. Other than causing stress to the children this also “places to account for issues of competency, confidentiality, privacy, and other conflicts of interest that arise when providers rely on informal or untrained interpreters to facilitate communication” (AMN Healthcare). Hospitals do not provide enough privacy to delicate information when making their children interpret.
