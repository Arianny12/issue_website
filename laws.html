        <p>Hospitals claim that they are able to provide valid methods of communication to deaf people, but what they provide is largely useless. In 2018, two deaf parents had no idea that their son was dying in front of them because the hospitals denied them access to an interpreter. After it was too late they provided an interpreter but their son ended up dying in front of them (Communication Service for the Deaf). They sued the hospital for not providing equal communication access but they lost the lawsuit because a part of the Americans with Disabilities Act states that “a hospital need not provide communication aids or services if doing so would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods or services offered or would result in an undue burden” (U.S. Department of Justice). This case perfectly exemplifies a problem in the Americans with Disabilities Act, creating ambiguity in the law which could cause healthcare systems to take advantage of it and would lead to not equally protecting those who are deaf.
